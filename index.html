Hello world
<br />All problems in computer science can be solved by another level of indirection
<br />Keep the database scale up (keep in single node) until scaling cost or high availability requirement forced to make it distributed (scale out)
<br />Before design scaling solution, it is very important to locate which operations will be common, and which will be rare. Or in otherway, need to define the load parameters for system
<br />The majority of the cost of system is not initial development but in its ongoing maintainance.
<br />Create a maintanability system means that avoi creating a legacy systems
<br />Abstraction is one of the best tools to reduce/remove the accident complexity (imagine programming language is a abstraction to machine code)
<br />The advantage of store ID instead of text: it never needs to change. ID can remains the same even if the information it identifies changes. Remove the duplication of changes all over the db -> it is the key idea behine normalization in db
<br />declarative(A) and imperative(B) language: B need to specifies both what and how to get obj. A only care about what you want, dont care how you get it --> enabled for optimization on the way to get the data. declarative query --> query optimizer --> db
<br />log in a general sense: an append-only sequence of records and doesn't have to be human-readable
<br />well-chosen indexes speed up read queries, but every index slows down write queries
<br />rather than plan for any eventuality, we should plan to allow for change by avoiding the urge to overspecify every last thing
